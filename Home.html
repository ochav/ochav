	<a><style>margin:30px</style> I first started listening to pop punk music when I was about 12. I am 20 now, so I have spent a lot of time getting to know the genre, many different bands, and listening to a lot of incredible albums! I have been building connections in the scene for a while now, and I even book some of these bands to play shows for UW-Madison! Stay tuned with this website to learn all I know about pop punk! </a>
